# OneClick Tools 🚀

## All Your Essential Tools in One Place

OneClick Tools is a comprehensive web application designed to provide a suite of powerful online utility tools, all accessible from a single, user-friendly platform. From image compression to currency conversion, and many more planned features, OneClick aims to streamline your daily digital tasks.

The application features a robust Flask backend for API management and user authentication, seamlessly integrated with Supabase. The frontend is built with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a responsive and intuitive user experience.

## ✨ Features

*   **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login system powered by Supabase.
*   **Personalized Dashboard:** A central hub for logged-in users to quickly access tools, view recent activity, and manage their profile.
*   **Image Compressor:**
    *   Reduce image file sizes (JPG, PNG, WebP) without compromising quality.
    *   Client-side processing ensures your images never leave your device, guaranteeing privacy.
    *   Customizable compression levels, output formats, and resizing options.
*   **Currency Converter:**
    *   Convert between 150+ world currencies with real-time exchange rates.
    *   Provides up-to-date conversion results and exchange rate tables.
*   **Intuitive UI/UX:** Clean, modern design with responsive layouts for various devices.
*   **Dark Mode Support:** Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Designed to easily integrate more tools and features in the future (e.g., PDF tools, video tools, text utilities).

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend
*   **Python 3.x**
*   **Flask:** Web framework for building APIs.
*   **Supabase:** Backend-as-a-Service for authentication and database.
*   **Flask-CORS:** Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
*   **python-dotenv:** Manages environment variables.

### Frontend
*   **HTML5:** Structure of the web pages.
*   **CSS3:** Styling, including responsive design and dark mode.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Client-side logic, interactivity, and API communication.
*   **Font Awesome:** Icon library.

### External APIs
*   **ExchangeRate-API:** For real-time currency exchange rates.
*   **UI Avatars:** For generating user avatars.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   A Supabase project (for authentication and database)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd OneClickTools
```

### 2. Set up Supabase

1.  Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
2.  In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to `Settings > API`.
3.  Copy your **Project URL** and **`anon` public key**.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the `MultipleFiles/` directory (or the root directory if you move `app.py` there) and add the following:

```
SECRET_KEY='your_flask_secret_key_here' # Generate a strong, random key
SUPABASE_URL='YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL'
SUPABASE_KEY='YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY'
```
*Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL` and `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY` with the values from your Supabase project.*

### 4. Install Backend Dependencies

Navigate to the `MultipleFiles/` directory (where `requirements.txt` is located) and install the required Python packages:

```bash
cd MultipleFiles/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Flask Backend

From the `MultipleFiles/` directory, run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```
The backend server will start, typically on `http://localhost:5000`. You should see messages in your terminal indicating that Supabase client is initialized and the server is running.

### 6. Access the Frontend

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```
This will serve the `index.html` file, and you can start exploring the application.
